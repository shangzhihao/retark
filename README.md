# Ruozhiba-Style LLM Fine-tuning

## Overview
Retark means retard talk. It is a project to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) using the Ruozhiba dataset to make the model adopt the distinctive tone and style of Ruozhiba (弱智吧, retard-bar), a popular Chinese internet forum known for its humorous, absurd, and often intentionally nonsensical content.

## Dataset

The Ruozhiba dataset contains posts and replies collected from the Ruozhiba forum. The content is characterized by:

- Intentionally illogical or absurd questions and statements
- Humorous and satirical tone
- Creative misuse of logic and common sense
- Internet slang and meme culture references
- Deliberate "low intelligence" expressions for comedic effect

The datasets used in this project are from the following repositories: [Better-Ruozhiba](https://github.com/FunnySaltyFish/Better-Ruozhiba), [ruozhiba](https://github.com/Leymore/ruozhiba).
